# Basic Port Checker
This project is intended to serve as a basic port scanner. It is a simple script meant to check if networks are open on a target IP. This should be obvious, but please don't use my code for anything illegal, this is only meant to help me improve my programming and cybersecurity skills. Not that it would be particularly useful for anything illegal anyway, but still.
